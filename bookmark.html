    <p style="color: blueviolet;">
        Generation in computer terminology is a change in technology a computer is/was being used.
        Initially, the generation term was used to distinguish between varying hardware technologies.
        Nowadays, generation includes both hardware and software, which together make up an entire
        computer system.
        There are five computer generations known till date. Each generation has been discussed in
        detail along with their time period and characteristics. In the following table, approximate dates
        against each generation has been mentioned, which are normally accepted.
        Following are the main five generations of computers
    </p>
    <h1 id="firstgeneration" style="color: chartreuse;">firstgeneration</h1>
    <p style="color: yellowgreen;">
        The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used
        vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing
        Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse
        frequently. Therefore, they were very expensive and only large organizations were able to
        afford it.
        In this generation, mainly batch processing operating system was used. Punch cards, paper
        tape, and magnetic tape was used as input and output devices. The computers in this generation
        used machine code as the programming language.
        The main features of the first generation are:
        • Vacuum tube technology
        • Unreliable
        • Supported machine language only
        • Very costly
        • Generates lot of heat
        • Slow input and output devices
        • Huge size
        • Need of AC
        • Non-portable
        • Consumes lot of electricity
    </p>
    <h1 id="secondgeneration" style="color: cadetblue;">secondgeneration</h1>
    <p style="color: cornflowerblue;">

        The period of second generation was from 1959-1965. In this generation, transistors were used
        that were cheaper, consumed less power, more compact in size, more reliable and faster than
        the first-generation machines made of vacuum tubes. In this generation, magnetic cores were
        used as the primary memory and magnetic tape and magnetic disks as secondary storage
        devices.
        In this generation, assembly language and high-level programming languages like FORTRAN,
        COBOL were used. The computers used batch processing and multiprogramming operating
        system.
        The main features of second generation are:
        • Use of transistors
        • Reliable in comparison to first generation computers
        • Smaller size as compared to first generation computers
        • Generates less heat as compared to first generation computers
        • Consumed less electricity as compared to first generation computers
        • Faster than first generation computers
        • Still very costly
        • AC required
        • Supported machine and assembly languages
        Some computers of this generation were:
        • IBM 1620
        • IBM 7094
        • CDC 1604
        • CDC 3600
        • UNIVAC 1108
    </p>
    <h1 id="thirdgeneration" style="color: cyan;"> thirdgeneration</h1>
    <p style="color: darkgreen;">
        The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. The computers of third generation used
        Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors. A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and
        capacitors along with the associated circuitry.
        The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable,
        and efficient. In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multi-programming operating
        system were used. High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1,
        BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation.
        The main features of third generation are:
        • IC used
        • More reliable in comparison to previous two generations
        • Smaller size
        • Generated less heat
        • Faster
        • Lesser maintenance
        • Costly
        • AC required
        • Consumed lesser electricity
        • Supported high-level language
        Some computers of this generation were:
        • IBM-360 series
        • Honeywell-6000 series
        • PDP (Personal Data Processor)
        • IBM-370/168
        • TDC-316
    </p>
    <h1 id="fourthgeneration" style="color: darkorange;">fourthgeneration</h1>
    <p style="color: deepskyblue;">
        The period of fourth generation was from 1971-1980. Computers of fourth generation used
        Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits having about 5000 transistors and
        other circuit elements with their associated circuits on a single chip made it possible to have
        microcomputers of fourth generation.
        Fourth generation computers became more powerful, compact, reliable, and affordable. As a
        result, it gave rise to Personal Computer (PC) revolution. In this generation, time sharing, real
        time networks, distributed operating system were used. All the high-level languages like C,
        C++, DBASE etc., were used in this generation.
        The main features of fourth generation are:
        • VLSI technology used
        • Very cheap
        • Portable and reliable
        • Use of PCs
        • Very small size
        • Pipeline processing
        • No AC required
        • Concept of internet was introduced
        • Great developments in the fields of networks
        • Computers became easily available
        Some computers of this generation were:
        • DEC 10
        • STAR 1000
        • PDP 11
        • CRAY-1(Super Computer)
        • CRAY-X-MP(Super Computer)
