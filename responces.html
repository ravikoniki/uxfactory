    COVAXINÂ®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian
    Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

    The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3)
    high containment facility.

    The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines
    do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead virus,
    incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an
    infection.</p>
