      The national drug regulator on Tuesday granted emergency use authorisation
      to US biotechnology firm Moderna for its vaccine against the novel
      coronavirus, paving the way for its Indian partner Cipla to import the
      first mRNA Covid-19 vaccine into the country for commercial use. This is
      also the first internationally developed vaccine to be granted a waiver
      from conducting bridging trials in India. While the government said
      details on the quantity of doses to be imported to India by Cipla are
      still under consideration, The Indian Express has learnt that the vaccine
      is initially expected to be provided to India in limited quantities — as
      donations by the US drug maker. The national drug regulator on Tuesday
