        Electronic Health Record (EHR) is longitudinal collection of electronic health information for and about
        persons, where health information is defined as information pertaining to the health of an individual or health
        care provided to an individual and it can support of efficient processes for health care delivery. In order to
        ensure successful operation of EHR, a Health Information Exchange (HIE) system is needed in place . However,
        most of the HIS in service are different and incompatible. Hence, effective health information exchange needs to
        be standardized for interoperable health information exchange between hospitals. Especially, clinical document
        standardization lies at the core of guaranteeing interoperability. CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) by
        Health Level Seven is a major standard for clinical documents. CDA is a document markup standard that specifies
        the structure and semantics of ‘clinical documents’ for the purpose of exchange. The first version of CDA was
        developed in 2001 and Release 2 came out in 2005. Many CDA-based projects have been successfully completed in
        many countries . Active works are being done on improving semantic interoperability based on open EHR and
        CEN13606. To ensure interoperability of HIE, the number of HIS that supports CDA needs to be sufficiently large.
        However, the structure of CDA is very complex and the production of correct CDA document is hard to achieve
        without deep understanding of the CDA standard and sufficient experience with it. </div><br><br>
