    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in
        a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages.<br> HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
        for the appearance of the document.<br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br> With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create structured
        documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other
        items.<br> HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. <br>Tags such as <img /> and
        <input /> directly introduce content into the page.<br> Other tags such as
    <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br> Browsers do
        not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages.<br> Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.<br> The World Wide Web
        Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the
        use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<br>
