        COVAXINÂ®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian
        Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).

        The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3)
        high containment facility.

        The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated
        vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. They contain dead
        virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction
        against an infection.

    New research led by Naresh Trehan of Medanta-The Medicity in India found the COVISHIELD (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona
    Virus Vaccine) vaccine produced an immune response from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
    (SARS-CoV-2) two weeks after vaccination with limited side effects.

    While national vaccination campaigns officially began on January 16, 2021, limited access has slowed the rollout.
    The COVISHIELD vaccine is produced by the Serum Institute of India and could help with the rising COVID-19 cases in
    India and prioritizing vaccines for frontline workers and at-risk groups.
